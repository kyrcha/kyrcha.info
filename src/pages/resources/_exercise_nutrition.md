### About the Exercise & Nutrition page

  Exercise and nutrition are the two variables one can tune in order to have a
  healthy life. My goal is to live an active and healthy life till my late days, 
  of course excluding things out of my reach like genetics and accidents. This is 
  my resource page of things I study and do with respect to exercise and nutrition, 
  i.e. the physical aspect of [sharpening the saw](http://amzn.to/2gcl7Rc). And like 
  the the ancients Greeks said: 

  With respect to exercising, I am into strength training. I started with the
  [stronglifts program](https://stronglifts.com/) (now with [Madcow](https://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5-training-programs/))
  and worked with [progressive loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_of_Croton#Feats_of_strength) 
  on the basic lifts: squats, bench presses, deadlifts, barbell rows, power cleans 
  and overhead presses, along with some assistance exercises like: barbell curl, 
  lying tricept extensions, dips, chinups, pullups, hyper-extensions and sit-ups.
  
  I also like to run from time to time and participate in running events.
