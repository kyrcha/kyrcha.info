This page contains machine learning (aka data mining/statistical inference) resources I have created like tutorials,
notes etc. and useful links to other websites.

I also keep a curated list of links in my [ml-directory github repo](https://github.com/kyrcha/ml-directory).

### Machine Learning Tutorials

List of tutorials I have created for various tasks and algorithms of machine learning.

  - Pre-processing
  - Feature Selection
  - Dimensionality Reduction with PCA and ICA

### Machine Learning Tutorials in R

The [Machine Learning Tutorials in R](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info) mini-site,
contains tutorials of classic machine learning algorithms and how they are used
within the R statistical environment. The mini-site has tutorials about:

  - [Introduction to R](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/intro.html)
  - Classification
    - [Decision Trees](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/dt.html)
    - [Naive Bayes](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/nb.html)
    - [k-Nearest Neighbors](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/knn.html)

I used [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
for [creating the mini-site](/2016/11/10/machine-learning-tutorials-mini-site).
The sources can be found [here](https://github.com/kyrcha/ml-tutorials).

### Datasets

My github repo containing links to datasets or site hosting datasets for
machine learning tasks:

- [My currated collection in GitHub](https://github.com/kyrcha/datasets-directory) including 3rd party 'awesome' collections.

### My Learning Deep Learning notes

Notes I've kept while studying Deep Learning. Under development.


### Books

Books I handpicked exist in this [amazon store](http://astore.amazon.com/stemfull-20).
