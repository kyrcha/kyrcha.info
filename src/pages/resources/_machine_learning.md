This page contains machine learning (aka data mining/statistical inference) resources I have created like tutorials, notes etc. and useful links to other websites.

I also keep a curated list of links in my [ml-directory github repo](https://github.com/kyrcha/ml-directory).

### Book

Along with [Themis Diamantopoulos](https://thdiaman.github.io/), [Michail Papamichail](https://issel.ee.auth.gr/staff/papamichail/) and [Andreas Symeonidis](https://issel.ee.auth.gr/staff/andreas-l-symeonidis/), I have co-authored a book entitled: [Practical Machine Learning in R](https://leanpub.com/practical-machine-learning-r).

The book is about quickly entering the world of creating machine learning models in R. The theory is kept to minimum and there are examples for each of the major algorithms for classification, clustering, feature engineering and association rules.

### Blog posts

Blog posts on Machine Learning:

  - Preprocessing

### Machine Learning Tutorials in R

The [Machine Learning Tutorials in R](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info) mini-site, contains tutorials of classic machine learning algorithms and how they are used within the R statistical environment. The mini-site has tutorials about:

  - [Introduction to R](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/intro.html)
  - [Classification](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/classification.html)
  - [Clustering](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/clustering.html)
  - [Data Engineering](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/data-eng.html)
  - [Other ML tasks](http://ml-tutorials.kyrcha.info/other.html)
    
I used [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
for [creating the mini-site](/2016/11/10/machine-learning-tutorials-mini-site).
The sources can be found [here](https://github.com/kyrcha/ml-tutorials).

### Datasets

My github repo containing links to datasets or site hosting datasets for
machine learning tasks:

- [My currated collection in GitHub](https://github.com/kyrcha/datasets-directory) including 3rd party 'awesome' collections.

### My Learning Deep Learning notes

Notes I've kept while studying Deep Learning. Under development.
