I started working with JavaScript in 2013 where I picked the MEAN stack as the stack of choice for building a web application at that time. The post [Going Mean](/2014/10/10/introductory-post-going-mean) explains the reasons. Since then I switched to the MERN stack. My [development portofilo page](/development) has some works I've done using it. Below some resources I gather now and then.

### Official MERN stack websites

The official sites of my favorite web building stack:

 - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 - [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    
Other cool official websites to augment the stack:

 - [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for GraphQL
 - [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

 ### JS rankings

  - [Modulecounts](http://www.modulecounts.com/) - In module counts npm registry is the largest and fastest growing module repository among others due to its micropackaging culture and the lack of standard library.
